# Changelog

All notable changes to prompt-vcs are documented in this file.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- An offline customer-support example with a runnable walkthrough and tests.

### Fixed

- Locked prompt versions now fail when a split-file template is invalid instead of
  rendering the code default; the VS Code extension also avoids previewing a
  different version when a lock is missing or invalid.
- YAML prompt files and JSON state files use atomic replacement, preserving the
  previous file when a write fails.
- VS Code definition lookup reads the lockfile from the current workspace root.
- Updated the VS Code extension's `js-yaml` dependency to the patched 5.2.2
  release.
- Stabilized Ruff rule selection in CI and refreshed the release workflow actions.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- `pvcs list`, `add`, `delete`, `unlock`, and `export` commands.
- JSON, OpenAI messages, and LangChain prompt export formats.
- Async `@prompt` decorator support.
- VS Code extension unit tests and multi-root workspace resolution.
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker.

### Changed

- A/B selection is thread-safe and validates identifiers, weights, scores, and
  duplicate versions.
- A/B winner detection now requires 95% confidence and uses Welch's t-test
  when the optional `analysis` dependency is installed.
- Prompt and lockfile caches reload automatically after file changes.
- Lockfiles and experiment configuration files are written atomically.
- Locked versions fail closed when the referenced template is missing.
- CI now covers Windows, the VS Code extension, distributions, and wheel CLI
  smoke tests.

### Fixed

- The first A/B request can no longer select one variant while rendering
  another.
- Zero-weight variants are never selected.
- A/B prompt results are real strings and cannot be recorded twice.
- `@prompt(default_version=...)` now selects the requested default YAML version.
